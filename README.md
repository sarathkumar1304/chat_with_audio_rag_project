This project combines the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with AssemblyAI's transcription capabilities, enabling you to interact with audio recordings as if they were conversational text. By leveraging DeepSeek R1 (or Meta-Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct) for natural language understanding, this solution efficiently retrieves and answers queries based on your audio content.

## 🚀 Features
- **Audio Transcription** using AssemblyAI for accurate speech-to-text conversion.
- **Qdrant Vector Database** for efficient retrieval and semantic search.
- **DeepSeek R1** via **SambaNova Cloud** for powerful language model responses.
- Seamless integration of transcription and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for improved context-aware conversations.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Transcription:** AssemblyAI transcribes your audio file, extracting speaker information for better clarity.
2. **Embedding Generation:** Text data is embedded using HuggingFace's `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` model.
3. **Vector Search:** Qdrant's vector database efficiently retrieves relevant context from indexed data.
4. **RAG Model Response:** DeepSeek R1 generates accurate and context-aware responses based on retrieved content.
